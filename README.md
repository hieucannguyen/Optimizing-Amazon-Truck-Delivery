# Optimizing-Amazon-Truck-Delivery
COE 322 Final Project
## Introduction
This project aims to address the complexities of optimizing Amazonâ€™s delivery truck scheduling, particularly focusing on the unique challenges posed by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and additionally implementing the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP)

For an in-depth explanation of the project read our [writeup](TSP_writeup.pdf)
